<h2>About</h2>About
There is the kind of chicken salad I want to eat in a sandwich (heavy on the mayo and celery, please), and there’s the
kind I want to lazily pick at over the course of an hours-long chic summer lunch. This recipe is my Platonic ideal of
the latter. The tender poached chicken breast is a perfect contrast to the fresh crunch of blanched green beans and
sweet corn (snap peas, radishes, or cucumbers would be right at home here too). The pot of boiling salted water does
double-duty here: first, getting the green beans crisp-tender, then serving as a gentle bath for the chicken breast. The
creamy, green, herb-packed goddess dressing and generous shower of fried shallots on top keep things feeling healthyish
not austere. —Christina Chaey

<h3>Tools You Will Need </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Blender</li>
    <li> Spider or Strainer</li>
    <li>Microplane Grater</li>
    <li>Citrus Juicer</li>
    <li>Mixing Bowls</li>
    <li>Slotted Spoon</li>
    <li>Large Pot</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<b>4 Servings</b>
<ul>
    <li>8oz. green beans, trimmed, halved crosswise</li>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>1 ear of corn, kernels removed (about 1 cup)</li>
    <li>2 skin-on chicken breasts (about 1½ lb.), split, or 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>1 oil-packed anchovy fillet</li>
    <li>1/4 avocado</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. (or more) fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp. red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup finely chopped mixed tender herbs (such as basil, chives, parsley, mint, and/or chervil), divided, plus
        more for serving</li>
    <li>3/4 cup store-bought fried shallots, divided</li>
    <li>2 small heads of tender lettuce (such as Little Gem or Bibb), leaves separated, torn if large</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
<p>Cook green beans in a large pot of boiling heavily salted water 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Add corn and cook until beans are bright green and crisp-tender and corn is just barely tender, about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a medium bowl of ice water; keep pot of water boiling. Let
    vegetables cool, then drain and transfer to a large bowl.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
<p>Add chicken to pot; return water to a gentle boil. </p> Reduce heat and cook at a bare simmer until juices run clear
when thickest part of chicken is pierced with the tip of a small knife (an instant-read thermometer inserted into
thickest part of chicken should register 150°; internal temperature will climb to 160° as chicken rests),
<p>20 to 25 minutes for skin-on, bone-in breasts; 10 to 15 minutes for skinless, boneless breasts.</p>
Transfer chicken to a plate; let cool slightly. <p>Shred meat into big pieces; discard skin and bones if present. Add
    shredded meat to bowl with vegetables.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
<p>Purée anchovy, avocado, oil, sour cream, lemon zest, lemon juice, vinegar, ½ cup herbs, and ¼ cup water in a blender,
    adding more water to thin if needed, until smooth and thick (dressing should be the consistency of heavy cream);
    season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Taste and add more lemon juice, salt, and/or pepper if needed (dressing should be bright and acidic).</p>

<h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
<p>Toss chicken and vegetables with half of dressing, half of fried shallots, and ¼ cup herbs. </p>
<p>Arrange lettuce on a platter; mound chicken salad on top.</p>
<p>Drizzle with more dressing.</p>
<p>Top with more herbs and remaining fried shallots.</p>
<p>Serve with remaining dressing alongside.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Do Ahead</em></strong></h4>
<p>Chicken can be cooked and shredded 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.</p>
