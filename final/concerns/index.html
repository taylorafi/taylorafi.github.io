            <h3>Safety</h3>


            <p>The joy in this new mode of transportation has caused electric scooter users to overlook some major
                issues that these scooters could bring about. </p>

            <p>Electric scooters may seem fun, but they have been causing a noticeable number of accidents. <a
                    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521004978?via%3Dihub">The Swedish
                    Transport Administration conducted a study</a> in Stockholm using datasets from reported injuries to
                Folksam Insurance and the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition database (STRADA). Below are some of
                their findings:</p>

        <p>As you can see, primarily 18-24 year olds are using these devices, making it a primary issue amongst
            college-age kids. </p>

        <p>Dr. Joann Elmore at UCLA and her team of researchers conducted a study on e-scooter injuries after they were
            noticing a rise in incidents within the Los Angeles region in UCLA's outpatient clinics, emergency
            departments and urgent care centers. </p>

        <p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266097#pone.0266097.s001">The
                Study </a>revealed shocking results:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Before the widespread use of e-scooters in the city, there were only about 13 injuries per year,
                    which increased to 595 in 2018 and 672 in 2019 around the time ride-share scooter companies started
                    to explode.</b></li>
            <li><b>There have been an estimated 115 injuries per million in their health system, which surpases the
                    <em>national average rate</em> of 104 injuries per million for motorcycles.</b></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I don't know about you, but that is pretty shocking...</p>


        <h3>Health</h3>

        <p>Everyone has been in these college kids' shoes.
        </p>

        <p>The majority of a college kids' day to day activities include:
        <ul>
            <li>sleeping,</li>
            <li>studying and doing school work,</li>
            <li>stressing out about classes,</li>
            <li>eating junk food,</li>
            <li>and, of course, drinking alcohol.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p>That does not leave much room for physical activity and their primary source of moving around becomes their
            walks across campus to class. However, e-scooters are actively eliminating what's left of any sort of work
            out for students.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/16/8676">In a study published by the U.S. Department of the
                Interior Office of Occupational Safety and Health</a>, researchers found that individuals can burn about
            nine times more energy by walking to their destination than they would riding a scooter.</p>

        <p>Yes, the scooters may save time when you're in a pinch. However, if using a scooter becomes a habitual
            practice to just sleep in longer before a class or because you're too lazy to walk, we may be in danger.</p>

        <p>Do we really want to end up like the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohcwksrvDOg"> WALL-E
                where people are floating around on chairs?</a> </p>
