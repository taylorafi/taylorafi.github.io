    <p>Stefon Mar'sean Diggs (born November 29, 1993) is an American football wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills of the
        National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Maryland, and was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings
        in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft.</p>

    <p>Diggs became a full-time starter for the Vikings midway through his rookie year despite his late-round draft
        status. He became part of an effective receiving tandem alongside Adam Thielen, with his highlights including
        catching the "Minneapolis Miracle" pass during the 2017to 2018 NFL playoffs. The following offseason, Diggs
        received a 5-year extension, playing two more seasons in Minnesota before being traded to Buffalo in 2020. With
        the Bills, he became the fastest receiver to surpass 100 catches with his new team and broke Eric Moulds'
        franchise record for receiving yards in a season. Diggs led all NFL receivers in 2020 with 127 receptions and
        1,535 receiving yards.</p>

    <h4 id="H">Early Years</h4>
    <p>Diggs attended Our Lady of Good Counsel High School in Montgomery County, Maryland, where he played football and
        ran track.[2] He recorded 810 yards receiving with 23 touchdowns as a junior in 2010, and was runner-up for the
        Gatorade Maryland Player of the Year. As a senior, he recorded 770 yards receiving and 8 touchdowns, and racked
        up 277 rushing yards and three more touchdowns on the ground; he also saw time on defense, recording 31.5
        tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, and 1 sack. In recognition of his efforts, he was a first team All-metro
        selection at wide receiver by The Washington Post and All-county selection by the Montgomery Gazette. Following
        his senior season, he was named MVP of the U.S. Army All-American Junior Combine in 2011 and was invited to play
        in the 2012 U.S. Army All-American Bowl</p>
    <p>In track and field, Diggs competed as a sprinter. In 2011, he placed 7th in the 100-meter dash in the prelims of
        the Bill Carver T&F Classic with a time of 12.00 seconds and helped lead his 4 by 200 m team to a third-place
        finish with a time of 1:32.10 minutes. The members of that relay consisted of fellow NFL players Kendall Fuller,
        Blake Countess, and a National Champion 400m sprinter Sean Sutton.[4][5] As a senior, he recorded a
        personal-best time of 22.30 seconds in the 200-meter dash at the Darius Ray Invitational and ran a third leg on
        the 4 by 100 m squad, helping the Falcons earn a second-place finish with a time of 43.50 seconds.[6] He was
        also timed at 4.43 seconds in the 40-yard dash.</p>
    <p>A consensus five-star recruit, Diggs was viewed as one of the best players in the nation. He was considered the
        second-best wide receiver recruit in the nation and was rated as the No.1 recruit in the state of Maryland by
        Rivals.com.[7] He was ranked as the No. 13 prospect in the nation and the No. 3 athlete in the class of 2012 by
        ESPN.com. Scout.com rated him as the No. 2 wide receiver prospect in the nation.[8] Diggs chose to stay close to
        home and committed to the University of Maryland on February 10, 2012.[9] He also had scholarship offers from
        Florida, USC, Cal, Ohio State, and Auburn, among others.</p>

        alt="Stefon Diggs Signs With Maryland">

    <h4 id="H2">College Career</h4>
    <p id="p1">
        Diggs accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Maryland in College Park, where he played on
        coach Randy Edsall's Maryland Terrapins football team from 2012 to 2014.
    </p>
    <h5 id="T"> <em>Freshman Season</em> (2012)</h5>

    <p>As a true freshman in 2012, Diggs played in 11 of Maryland's 12 games at wide receiver and on special teams,
        missing just one game, due to an ankle injury.[12] He ranked second in the ACC and eighth nationally with 172.4
        all-purpose yards per game, while his 1,896 all-purpose yards were the second most in a single season in school
        history, trailing only Torrey Smith, who posted 2,192 yards in 2009. He ranked fifth in the conference in
        receiving yards (77.1/game), second in kick return average (28.5), and fifth in punt return average (10.0). He
        led the team in receptions (54), receiving yards (848), and touchdown receptions (6). In his first collegiate
        game against William & Mary, he caught three passes for 30 yards and returned three punts for a total of 50
        yards.[13] He totaled 223 all-purpose yards, which came on 57 receiving yards, 68 yards on five punt returns and
        98 yards on three kickoff returns against Connecticut.[14] For his performance against West Virginia, he
        received ACC Rookie of the Week honors after posting 201 all-purpose yards, including three receptions for 113
        yards and two touchdowns, 63 yards on three kickoff returns and 25 yards on four punt returns.[15] He started at
        wide receiver vs. Wake Forest, and recorded a second straight 100-yard receiving game with 105 yards on five
        receptions; his 63-yard reception in the fourth quarter was the longest by a Terp for the season and set up the
        game-winning touchdown by Justus Pickett.[16] He earned ACC Rookie of the Week honors for his play. Against
        Virginia, he caught four passes for 89 yards (including a long of 60 yards) and totaled 147 yards on three
        kickoff returns (one for a 100-yard touchdown), recording 239 all-purpose yards and earning ACC Specialist of
        the Week honors.[17] He totaled 152 yards on a season-high 11 receptions, including a 66-yard touchdown against
        Boston College, earning ACC Rookie of the Week for the third time.[18] He recorded eight catches for 82 yards at
        North Carolina, had four kick returns for 146 yards, including a 99-yard touchdown return to open the second
        half. He also completed his first career pass for an eight-yard touchdown at the end of the first half.[19] He
        finished second to Miami's Duke Johnson in the ACC Freshman of the Year voting.</p>

    <h5 id="T2"><em>Sophomore Season</em> (2013)</h5>
    <p>
        As a sophomore in 2013, Diggs played in only seven games, missing the final six games of the season after
        suffering a season-ending injury at Wake Forest. He was an honorable mention All-ACC selection by the media and
        coaches despite the injury. He began his sophomore campaign with an impressive game against FIU, recording 98
        yards receiving and one touchdown and 70 return yards on three kickoffs.[21] His impressive play carried over
        against Old Dominion by recording a career-best 179 yards receiving and a touchdown, earning ACC Receiver of the
        Week honors for his play.[22] He had 110 receiving yards and a touchdown against Connecticut.[23] However, in
        Maryland's 34–10 loss to Wake Forest, Diggs broke his right fibula, ending his season. In that game, Diggs
        managed to pull in eight catches for 67 yards. For the season, he hauled in 34 passes for 587 yards and 3
        touchdowns.[24]
    </p>

    <h5 id="T3"> <em>Junior Season</em>(2014)</h5>
    <p>As a junior, in his final season at Maryland, Diggs played in 10 games but again missed games due to injury. He
        earned second team All-Big Ten honors from the coaches and was named an honorable mention All-Big Ten honoree by
        the media. He led the team in receptions with 62, receiving yards with 792 and receiving touchdowns with five
        all in ten games.[25] He had three 100-yard receiving games for the season, which tied for fourth in the
        conference. He hauled in five balls for 127 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown (the longest touchdown
        reception of his career) against West Virginia on September 13.[26] He brought in six catches for 112 yards and
        a touchdown at Indiana.[27] He posted a team-high seven catches for 52 yards and a score against Ohio State.[28]
        He tallied a team-high nine receptions for 130 yards and took a short screen pass 53 yards for a touchdown
        against Iowa.[29] He missed the Michigan State game due to suspension and the final two games due to a lacerated
        kidney.[30] In his first game since suffering a lacerated kidney on November 1, Diggs was one of the few bright
        spots during Maryland's 45–21 loss to Stanford; he had 10 catches for 138 yards, including a 26-yard
        catch-and-run that helped set up the Terps' first touchdown.</p>

    <h4 id="H3"> Professional Career </h4>

    <p id="P2">After his junior season, Diggs decided to forgo his senior season and entered the 2015 NFL Draft. Diggs
        (6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 190 pounds (86 kg)) ran the 40-yard dash in 4.46 seconds at the 2015 NFL Combine, and stood
        on those numbers at his Pro Day. He ran the 20-yard shuttle in 4.11 seconds and also had a 60-yard long shuttle
        time of 11.46 seconds.</p>

    <h5 id="T4">Minnesota Vikings</h5>

    <p>Diggs was selected in the fifth round with the 146th overall pick by the Minnesota Vikings in the 2015 NFL
        Draft.[36] He signed a four-year, $2.5 million deal that included a guaranteed $227,000 signing bonus.[37]</p>
    <p><strong>2015 Season</strong></p>
    <p>Diggs was inactive during the Vikings' first three games of the season. He got his first chance to play in Week 4
        against the Denver Broncos because of injuries to receivers Charles Johnson and Jarius Wright and responded with
        six catches on ten targets and a team-high 87 yards in Minnesota's 23–20 loss at Denver.[38] In his first career
        start against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 6, Diggs took full advantage to become the first Vikings' receiver
        since Week 14 in the previous season to record a 100-yard game, finishing with seven catches for 129 yards,
        including a 30-yard reception on a crucial third-down.[39] Diggs officially received the starting wide receiver
        role, opposite that of teammate Mike Wallace, against the Detroit Lions in Week 7. Diggs put up his second
        straight 100-yard game, hauling in six passes for 108 yards; in the third quarter, Diggs beat veteran cornerback
        Rashean Mathis with a double move then laid out to make a highlight-reel 36-yard touchdown catch in the end
        zone, the first of his NFL career.[40] Since Randy Moss in 1998, Diggs was the first Vikings rookie to record
        consecutive 100-yard games, and 80 or more receiving yards in his first three games. In the Vikings' 23–20 win
        over the Chicago Bears in Week 8, Diggs recorded his fourth consecutive game with at least five catches and 80
        yards.[41] On a crucial third-down play with only 2:00 left, Diggs caught a short pass from Teddy Bridgewater at
        the 30-yard line, then he spun around cornerback Sherrick McManis and turned upfield over his right shoulder
        with open space in front of him. He shook a defender at the five-yard line and dove past another into the end
        zone, tying the game 20–20. Diggs wound up being the Vikings' leading receiver, hauling in six catches for 95
        yards and a 40-yard touchdown. Diggs' yardage over four games ranks him second among all NFL players in their
        first four career games since 1960, behind only Anquan Boldin's 464 yards in 2003.</p>
    <p>In Week 9, Diggs led the team in receptions (3) and yards (42) and recovered a fumble by Adrian Peterson in the
        Vikings' overtime win over the St. Louis Rams.[42] Diggs recorded two receptions for 46 yards in the Vikings
        week 10 win over the Oakland Raiders.[43] In the Vikings' loss to Green Bay in Week 11, Diggs topped the 50-yard
        receiving mark for the first time in three weeks, recording six receptions for 66 yards.[44] In Week 12, against
        the Atlanta Falcons, Diggs recorded four receptions for 31 yards. During the game, he had an unsportsmanlike
        conduct penalty due to his celebration of spinning the ball into Falcons' safety Charles Godfrey after his
        16-yard reception in converting a 3rd & 8.[45][46] After a quiet six-game streak, Diggs re-emerged in Week 15
        against the Chicago Bears; he hauled in three receptions for 55 yards with a career-high two touchdowns that
        helped the Vikings defeat the Bears 38–17. He caught his first of the day in Minnesota's first drive on a
        15-yard pass in the back-left corner of the end zone from Bridgewater for a 7–0 lead. On his second score,
        Bridgewater found him on a short crossing pattern across the middle on third down and Diggs accelerated towards
        the sidelines, juked one defender and carried another on his back for seven yards to complete a 33-yard catch
        and run that put the Vikings up 24–7.[47] On January 19, 2016, Diggs was named to the Pro Football Writers of
        America's (PFWA) 2015 NFL All-Rookie team. Despite being inactive for the first three games of the 2015
        campaign, Diggs led the Vikings in receptions with 52 and receiving yards with 720 yards including 13 receptions
        of 20+ yards.[48] It was the 2nd-most receiving yardage by a rookie that year behind Raiders' wideout Amari
        Cooper (1,070).</p>

    <p><strong>2016 Season</strong></p>
    <p>In the season opening game at the Tennessee Titans on September 11, Diggs led the Vikings with seven catches for
        103 yards on nine targets.[49] Despite being listed as the team's No. 2 wide receiver behind Charles Johnson,
        Diggs still led the team in targets, receptions, and yards as the Vikings were forced to throw more than
        expected with the Titans bottling up the running game.[50] In Week 2, Diggs posted another stellar performance
        against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. With the Packers stacking the box to stop the running
        game, Diggs exploited man-to-man coverage from second-year cornerback Damarious Randall and became the focal
        point of the offense, playing a key role in the Vikings' 17–14 win over the Packers as he finished the game with
        career-highs in both catches with nine and receiving yards with 182.[51] This game was Sam Bradford's first as a
        Viking, and the team's first in the new U.S. Bank Stadium. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week,
        becoming the ninth different Viking to earn NFC Player of the Week honors under head coach Mike Zimmer.
        Combining his 182 yards with his 103-yard performance at Tennessee in Week 1, Diggs became only the third
        receiver in team history to have back-to-back 100-plus-yard games in the first two games of the season, joining
        Gene Washington (152 and 172 in 1969) and Cris Carter (121 and 107 in 1997).[52] After Week 2, Diggs was the
        leader in receiving yards in the NFL.[53] In the Vikings' overtime loss against the Detroit Lions in Week 9,
        Diggs set a personal-best with 13 catches for 80 yards, which passed Randy Moss and Percy Harvin (10 apiece) for
        receptions against the Lions.[54] His 13 receptions also set a team record for most receptions in a November
        game and ranks third all-time behind Rickey Young (15) and Cris Carter (14).[55] Diggs was part of a receiving
        duo, along with Adam Thielen, that became the first pair of Vikings wide receivers with 900 yards each since
        Randy Moss and Cris Carter accomplished that back in 2000. Diggs finished the season with 84 receptions on 111
        targets for 903 yards and three touchdowns.[56] His 75% catch rate ranked fifth among NFL wide receivers in
        2016.[57]</p>
    <p><strong>2017 Season</strong></p>
    <p>On September 11, 2017, in the season opener against the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football, Diggs caught
        seven receptions for 93 yards and two touchdowns.[58] During Week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Diggs
        posted an impressive performance with 173 receiving yards and two touchdowns as the Vikings won by a score of
        34–17.[59] With 98 more yards in a Week 4 loss to the Detroit Lions, he led the NFL in receiving yards.[60] In
        the Week 5 victory against the Chicago Bears, Diggs would only record a single catch for four yards, leaving the
        field early with a groin injury.[61] The groin injury would sideline Diggs for both the Week 6 victory against
        the Green Bay Packers and the Week 7 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens.[62] Even after missing two straight
        games, Diggs would remain 13th on the list for receiving yards.[63] In 14 starts, Diggs finished with 849
        receiving yards and eight touchdowns.</p>
    <p>The Vikings finished the 2017 season with a 13–3 record, clinching the NFC North division and a bye in the first
        round of the playoffs.[65] In the NFC divisional round against the New Orleans Saints, Diggs finished with 137
        receiving yards and a touchdown. With only 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Diggs made the winning
        play with a 61-yard touchdown, giving the Vikings a dramatic 29–24 win, dubbed the "Minneapolis
        Miracle".[66][67] In the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had eight receptions for 70 yards
        in the 38–7 loss.[68] He was ranked 65th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.</p>

        alt="Diggs celebrating after scoring a touchdown against the Washington Redskins.">
    <p><strong>2018 Season</strong></p>
    <p>On July 31, 2018, Diggs signed a five-year, $72 million contract extension with the Vikings through the 2023
        season.[70][71] During Week 1, Diggs caught Kirk Cousins's first touchdown pass as a Viking in a 24to16 win over
        the San Francisco 49ers.[72] In Week 2, a 29to29 tie against the Green Bay Packers, Diggs recorded nine
        receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns, one of which was a career-long 75-yard touchdown.[73] In Week 4, he
        had 11 receptions for 123 receiving yards in a 38to31 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[74] In Week 11, Diggs had 13
        catches for 126 yards and a touchdown in a 25to20 loss to the Chicago Bears.[75] He finished the 2018 season
        with 102 receptions for 1,021 yards and nine touchdowns.[76] Diggs and Adam Thielen gave the Vikings their first
        pair of 1,000+ yard receivers since Moss and Carter in 2000.</p>

    <p><strong>2019 Season</strong></p>
    <p>In Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, Diggs caught one pass for a 49-yard touchdown as the Vikings lost
        21–16.[78] In Week 4 against the Chicago Bears, Diggs caught seven passes for 108 yards in the 16–6 loss.[79]
